# DistributedSetup

This is my own documentation in setting up a distributed system for a PHP system.

In each folder, there is a ReadMe with instructions on setting up each components.

## Overall system
- Load balancer: HAProxy with Let'sEncrypt
- Web server: Apache + PHP + Memcache
- Database: MySQL Replication
- Google Storage: Cloud Storage Bucket
